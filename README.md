Open-source MATLAB/Octave software libraries for **dynamic or static retina image analysis**, incluging:
- image registration
- optic disc or vessel segmentation tools
- blind source separation algorithms (i.e. principal component analysis - PCA, independent component analysis - ICA)
- one-dimensional spike noise suppresion K-means filter
- automatic detection of control points in periodic time-courses.
